# Supervised ML Models

This project demonstrates key supervised learning algorithms:
- **Linear Regression:** Predicts continuous values.  
- **Logistic Regression:** Handles binary classification.  
- **Decision Tree:** Rule-based splits for classification/regression.  
- **Random Forest:** Combines trees for accuracy.  
- **SVM:** Finds optimal class boundaries.
